# PodFazer!
PodFazer! is an educational project that repurposes components from electronic cigarettes (vapes) to create affordable and safe robotics kits. The parts connect like puzzle pieces, preventing short circuits and making it easy for children to explore electronics in a hands-on and playful way.

Designed to democratize access to electronics education in public and private schools, PodFazer! reduces the cost of traditional kits from R$150 to R$80 and supports expansion via a micro:bit programming module.

Developed by Marcelo Dias De Freitas Junior (SESI network employee) and Rafael Henrique Prudencio (3rd-year high school student), the project is open source and was created as a solution for the 1st Hackathon by the Brazilian Federal Revenue.
