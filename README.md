# PodFazer! – Sustainable Educational Robotics Kit

**PodFazer!** is an open-source project that transforms discarded electronic cigarette (vape) components into affordable educational robotics kits. Using puzzle-shaped modular parts, the project aims to **make electronics education accessible, sustainable, and safe** for all.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To promote hands-on electronics learning for children and teens by using repurposed components and intuitive connections, lowering costs and eliminating short-circuit risks.

---

## 🎯 Problem It Solves

- High cost of educational kits (reduced from R$150 to R$80)
- Low accessibility to electronics education in public schools
- Lack of practical engagement in traditional methods
- Improper disposal of vapes and electronic waste

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The kit includes:

- **Modular MDF parts** shaped like puzzle pieces (preventing short circuits)
- **Repurposed components** from vapes (buttons, LEDs, sensors, etc.)
- **Optional micro:bit module**, enabling programming with blocks (Scratch) or Python

Children can learn by building real circuits in a safe and intuitive way, with or without code.
